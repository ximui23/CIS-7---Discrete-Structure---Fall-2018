This is the video about the recurrence relations, which is described through series in mathematic. 
The video explains the concept of Recurrence Relations through the examples of series of numbers, 
  which help me understand clearly about the concept.
It also reminds me of the knowledge that I have learned in Calculus, and I can see the application of Series in logic.
Through that logic, I can see the relationship between coding and mathematics while doing the assignment of Tower of Hanoi.
