PART 1:
Proove each of the following. Indicate which proof method you are using and show your work.

Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
  Suppose the square root of 2 is rational 
  -> the square root of 2 can be presented in a form of rational, which is a/b
  -> assume a and b no common factor, which means they are both odd
  ->      the square root of 2 = a/b
  ->                   2 = a^2/b^2
  ->                  a^2 = 2 x b^2
  -> a^2 is even 
  -> a must be even
  -> a^2 can divide by 2
  -> b^2 is even 
  -> b must be even
  -> both a and b are even, which is a contradiction with the assumption that we made at the beginning
  -> Square root of 2 is not rational
  => Square root of 2 is irrational.
  (Use contradiction proof)
  
  If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
  
    n = 25, a perfect square
    Also, n = 25 = 9 + 16, where 9, ans 16 are perfect squares
    -> the statement is true
    
    n = 100 , a perfect square
    Also, n = 100 = 36 + 64, 
    64, 36 are perfect squares
    -> the statement is true
    
    n = 169, a perfect square
    Also, n = 169 = 100 + 69 
    100, 69 are perfect squares
    -> the statement is true
    
    (Use Exhausted proof)
   
   
The sum of two odd integers is even. Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1
    odd integers = 2n +- 1
    even integers = 2n
    
    Sum of two odd integers = (2n + 1) + (2n + 1)
                            =  4n + 2
                            =  2(2n + 1)
    Let k = 2n + 1
      -> sum of two odd integers = 2k 
      -> by definition, 2k is even integer
    (Direct Proof)
      
 The sum of an even integer and it's square is even
    even integer = 2n
    even integer's square = (2n)^2 = 4n^2
    sum of an even integer and it's square is :
          2n + (2n)(2n)
        = 2n(2n+1)
    let k = 2n + 1
    ->  sum = 2nk
    let m = nk
    ->  sum = 2m
    ->  sum is even
    (Direct Proof)
    
  If n squared is odd, then n is odd
