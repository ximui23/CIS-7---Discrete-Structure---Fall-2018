PART 1:

Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
  Suppose the square root of 2 is rational 
  -> the square root of 2 can be presented in a form of rational, which is a/b
  -> assume a and b no common factor, which means they are both odd
  ->      the square root of 2 = a/b
  ->                   2 = a^2/b^2
  ->                  a^2 = 2 x b^2
  -> a^2 is even 
  -> a must be even
  -> a^2 can divide by 2
  -> b^2 is even 
  -> b must be even
  -> both a and b are even, which is a contradiction with the assumption that we made at the beginning
  -> Square root of 2 is not rational
  => Square root of 2 is irrational.
